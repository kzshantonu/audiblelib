window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They say every cloud has a silver lining....</p> <p>When Freya Miller is struck by tragedy, losing her husband and her home within a short time, she is burdened with many worries. The main one being where she and her five-year old daughter, Skye, are going to live. A chance meeting with the charismatic Dr Marsden changes all that. He offers the young mother the most amazing opportunity: an apartment at one of London’s most exclusive addresses for a fraction of the market rental cost. It’s an offer Freya simply can’t refuse. Within a couple of weeks, Freya and Skye are moving into Adder House and meeting the other welcoming residents. They very quickly feel part of the family.</p> <p>But just when Freya truly believes all her problems are history, a series of strange, unexplained occurrences begin. It leaves Freya with the unshakeable feeling that even when their apartment door is securely locked, she and her daughter are not alone. Freya thought she’d left all her troubles behind her, yet she soon realises there are problems here that are far more terrifying than before.</p> <p>For behind the doors of Adder House, everything is most definitely not as it seems.</p> <p>Old secrets refuse to stay buried, and someone is determined to keep a terrible past very much alive.</p>";
