As Adrian looks back on their brief but seemingly happy marriage, disturbing secrets begin to surface.&nbsp;</p> <p>The divorces from his two previous wives had been amicable, or so it seemed; his children, all five of them, were resilient as ever, or so he thought. But something, or someone, must have pushed Maya over the edge.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fans of Liane Moriarty and Jojo Moyes will be captivated by this riveting family drama with a dark mystery at its core.</p>";
