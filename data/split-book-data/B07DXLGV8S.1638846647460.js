window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Before the words <i>white supremacy</i> filled the airways, before we learned of American Nazis and the alt-right, before there was a Muslim ban, before we considered building a wall or knew what DACA stands for, there was eugenics - a pseudoscience that promoted the belief&nbsp;that&nbsp;a race could be improved by controlling who was allowed to mate with whom.</p> <p>It was eugenics that&nbsp;compelled white doctors to&nbsp;attempt to murder Baby John.&nbsp;It was compassion that led to his kidnapping.&nbsp;And it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the cruelest of circumstances - the murder of Jennifer Rice - that&nbsp;50 years later&nbsp;leads Shep Harrington to search for Baby John.</p> <p>As Shep soon learns,&nbsp;the quest&nbsp;brings him to the top of a slippery slope with an ill-defined edge. Question begets question, and the slide down the slope proves inevitable: What happened to the baby?&nbsp;Who took it? Why was he taken?&nbsp;And who killed Jennifer Rice?</p> <p>When Shep learns that Baby John was born at a hospital run by Alton Nichols, a famous Virginia eugenicist, he is drawn into the dark history of the American eugenics movement&nbsp;and its proponents - the so-called \"gene police\".</p>";
