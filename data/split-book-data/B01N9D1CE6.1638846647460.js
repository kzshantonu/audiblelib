window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The author of the <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>I Let You Go</i> propels listeners into a dark and claustrophobic thriller in which a normal, everyday woman becomes trapped in the confines of her normal, everyday world.</b> </p> <p>Every morning and evening, Zoe Walker takes the same route to the train station, waits at a certain place on the platform, finds her favorite spot in the car, never suspecting that someone is watching her. </p> <p>It all starts with a classified ad. During her commute home one night, while glancing through her local paper, Zoe sees her own face staring back at her - a grainy photo along with a phone number and a listing for a website called FindTheOne.com. </p> <p>Other women begin appearing in the same ad, a different one every day, and Zoe realizes they've become the victims of increasingly violent crimes - including murder. With the help of a determined cop, she uncovers the ad's twisted purpose, a discovery that turns her paranoia into full-blown panic. Zoe is sure that someone close to her has set her up as the next target. </p> <p>And now that man on the train - the one smiling at Zoe from across the car - could be more than just a friendly stranger. He could be someone who has deliberately chosen <i>her</i> and is ready to make his next move. </p>";
