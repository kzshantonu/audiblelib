I didn't have anything to do with Frank's death. I don't have an alibi, so you'll have to take my word for it.... </i> </p> <p>Forty-eight hours after leaving her husband's body at the base of the stairs, Tanya Dubois cashes in her credit cards, dyes her hair brown, demands a new name from a shadowy voice over the phone, and flees town. It's not the first time. </p> <p>She meets Blue, a female bartender who recognizes the hunted look in a fugitive's eyes and offers her a place to stay. With dwindling choices, Tanya-now-Amelia accepts. An uneasy - and dangerous - alliance is born. </p> <p>It's <i>almost</i> impossible to live off the grid today, but Amelia-now-Debra and Blue have the courage, the ingenuity, and the desperation to try. Hopscotching from city to city, Debra especially is chased by a very dark secret.... Can she outrun her past? </p> <p>With heart-stopping escapes and devious deceptions, <i>The Passenger</i> is an amazing psychological thriller about defining yourself while you pursue your path to survival.
