window.bookSummaryJSON = "Marc Seidman awakens to find himself in an ICU, hooked up to an IV, his head swathed in bandages. Twelve days earlier, he had had an enviable life as a successful surgeon, living in a peaceful suburban neighborhood with his beautiful wife and a baby he adored. Now he lies in a hospital bed, shot by an unseen assailant. His wife has been killed, and his 6-month-old daughter, Tara, has vanished. But just when his world seems forever shattered, something arrives to give Marc a new hope: a ransom note. <p> Both a white-knuckle thriller and a story about the loyalty of old friends and the bond between parent and child, <i>No Second Chance</i> is another masterpiece from an author who writes \"suspense at its finest\" (Jeffrey Deaver).</p>";
