window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Claire sees Hannah Wilson at an exclusive Manhattan hair salon, it's like a knife slicing through barely healed scars. It may have been 10 years since Claire last saw Hannah, but she has thought of her every day, and not in a good way. So Claire does what anyone would do in her position - she stalks her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hannah is now Mrs. Carter, living the charmed life that should have been Claire's. It's the life Claire used to have before Hannah came along and took it all away from her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Back then, Claire was a happy teenager with porcelain skin and long blond wavy hair. Now she's an overweight, lazy drunk with hair the color of compost and skin to match. And thatâ€™s why when Hannah advertises for a housekeeper, Claire is confident she can apply and not be recognized - especially since she has time on her hands, revenge on her mind, and a talent for acting....&nbsp;</p> <p>What better way to seek retribution - and redress - than from within the beautiful Mrs. Hannah Carter's own home?&nbsp;</p> <p>But it's not just Claire who has secrets. Everyone in that house seems to have something to hide.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>And now, there's no way out.</b></p>";
