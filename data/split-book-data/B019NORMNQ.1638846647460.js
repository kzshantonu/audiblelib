window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The unpause-able novel of one man's quest to find the source of his nightmare and to reverse it before he becomes...nothing at all. This number-one national best seller from Stephen King, writing as Richard Bachman, \"pulsates with evil...it will have you on the edge of your seat\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>). </p> <p>Billy Halleck commits vehicular manslaughter when his lack of attention results in the death of an old gypsy lady on the street. Overweight Halleck is a lawyer with connections, though, and he gets off with a slap on the wrist. After the trial, the victim's ancient father curses him with a single word: \"thinner\". Shedding weight by the week, Halleck is desperate enough for one last gamble...one that will lead him to a nightmare showdown with the forces of evil melting his flesh away. </p> <p>With an introduction by Stephen King on \"The Importance of Being Bachman\", <i>Thinner</i> is a novel of \"undeniable suspense\" (<i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>) and \"genuine chills\" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>). </p>";
