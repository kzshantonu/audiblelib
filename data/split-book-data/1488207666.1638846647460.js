After recovering from being shot and surviving the rough streets of Lindenwood, he doesn’t care about anyone or anything.</p> <p>Golden girl Nandy Smith has spent most of her life building the pristine image it takes to make it in Pacific Hills. After learning that her parents are taking in a troubled teen boy, Nandy fears her summer plans and her reputation will go up in flames.</p> <p>The wall between their bedrooms feels as thin as the line between love and hate. But&nbsp;their growing attraction won't be denied. Soon Trice is bringing Nandy out of her shell and Nandy's trying to melt the ice around Trice's heart. But with the ever-present pull back to Lindenwood, it’ll be a wonder if Trice makes it through this summer at all.</p> <p><b>Also by Whitney D.
