window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>An absolutely gripping psychological thriller with a brilliant twist</i></b></p> <p><b>Marianne</b> has a life others dream of. A beautiful townhouse on the best street in the neighbourhood. Three bright children who are her pride and joy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sometimes her past still hurts: losing her mother early, growing up in foster care. But her husband, <b>Simon</b>, is always there. A successful surgeon, he’s the envy of every woman they’ve ever met. Flowers, gifts, trips to France: nothing is too good for his family.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then Simon says another woman’s name. The way he lingers on it, <b><i>Caroline</i></b>, gives Marianne a shudder of suspicion, but she knows it’s nothing - she can’t entertain this flash of paranoia.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the old days, she’d have distracted herself by excelling at work, but Marianne left her glamorous career when she married. She’d speak to a friend, but she’s too busy with her children and besides, Simon doesn’t approve of the few she has left.&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s almost by accident that Marianne starts to learn more about Caroline. But once started, she can’t stop, because what she finds makes her wonder: is the question she should be asking not \"should I be jealous\" but...\"should I be scared?\"</p> <p><b>Fans of </b><b><i>The Girl on the Train</i></b><b> and</b><b><i> I Let You Go</i></b><b> who are looking for a dark, gripping psychological thriller with a final twist to put their jaw on the floor will love </b><b><i>Our Little Lies.</i></b></p>";
